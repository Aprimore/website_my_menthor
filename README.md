# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn` or `bun`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building
To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```
You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

> Deploy Static website to Hostgator: Run `npm run build`, open the folder `build`, zip everything, go to Hostgator Cpanel, File Manager, upload the zip folder, unzip, delete the .zip, done.# website_my_menthor
